            <h1>Welcome to The Chelmsford Hypnotherapy Practice </h1>
            <h3>Some background...</h3>
            <p>I started my professional life as a Registered General Nurse and spent 8 rewarding years working for the NHS. I then went into the Corporate world of Pharmaceutical Sales where I enjoyed 20 years of successful career development. In my search for something more fulfilling I became interested in Hypnotherapy 14 years ago.
                <br><br> I trained to advance Diploma Level at Contemporary College of Therapeutic studies where I also completed the Practitioner and Master NLP Practitioner Courses. For the last seven years I have practiced full time and have had the opportunity to work with people suffering all manner of psychological and emotional difficulties. 
                <br><br>For some clients, the journey is challenging, but for many a few sessions can have a profound impact on their lives and the change they want to bring about. I am incredibly passionate about what I do, and my aim is always to treat you, with respect and confidentiality, and to help you achieve the changes in your life that will enable you to become the YOU, you want to be.
                <br><br>In addition to working from  the Chelmsford Hypnotherapy practice for personal therapy, I also run programmes for Anxiety & Stress Management. Group therapy I find very rewarding, as the group dynamic is a challenging, and fun environment and the  psychotheraputic benefit is gained not only from the strategic interventions I teach you but also the peer support you recieve. It also enables me to offer therapy in a more affordable way.
                <br><br>More recently I have begun running Assertiveness Workshops and Sept 2019 sees the launch of Therapeutic Public Speaking Courses.
                <br><br>Having been a tutor for 5 years at my training school, I am now working with the director of Evolve College teaching a Life Coaching Course at Birkbeck University that is accredited by the IAPC&M. This is an incredible opportunity to teach people who are looking to change career and become accredited Life-Coaches the skills and knowledge to help meet the demand for professional psychological and emotional support that is ever growing in our society today.</p>
