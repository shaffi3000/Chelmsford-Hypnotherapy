            <h3>What is Hypnotherapy?</h3>
            <p>It is a form of deep relaxation, I often compare it to the feelings you have just before you go into sleep, or just as soon as you start to awake. When youâ€™re not quite sure where you are, but it feels lovely, safe and comfortable, with little or no awareness of any disharmony.  It is a period of conscious shutdown, where everything still functions normally, with the help of the subconscious mind, but you are not consciously aware of it. This is hypnosis.... <br><br>
                And apart from being very relaxing, it is an incredibly resourceful state as you are able to access the subconscious mind which is far more receptive to change...which has significant therapeutic benefit.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-10 mainCol">
            <h3>What Can Hypnotherapy be Used For?</h3>

            <h3>Do You need help overcoming Anxiety?</h3>
            <p>Many people struggle with anxiety or stress on a daily basis and believe that that's just the way it is... there's nothing they can do about it. And yet, it's getting worse, week by week, month by month.</p>
            <p class="textHide" id="anxityMore">We are living in stressful times and many of us struggle to manage demanding jobs, busy households and the countless demands on our time. As a consequence Anxiety is becoming more common resulting in time off work, physical illness, difficult relationships and general unhappiness.
                <br><br>When Anxiety becomes severe, it can be debilitating, isolating, and scary.
                <br><br>If you are experiencing stress or anxiety that stops you from doing the things you want... restricts your life in some way, then I want you to know there is something you can do... before it becomes unmanageable. 
                <br><br>Please take the next step and get in touch. I can help you learn to overcome the anxiety and access alternative ways of dealing with and eventually beating it for good!</p>
                <p class="textHide"><i><strong>Most clients experience a significant improvement in between 4 and 6 weeks even if they have suffered from Anxiety for many years.</strong></i></p>

            <h3>Do you need help losing weight?</h3>
            <p>I believe today's stressful lifestyle has contributed to the high level of emotional overeating, bingeing and an unhealthy relationship with food. Being so accessible, we are bombarded with affordable unhealthy food at every turn. </p>
            <p class="textHide">Most of the clients I see for weight management have done countless diets, attended slimming clubs and haven't succeeded in reaching their ideal weight. Often losing weight only to put it back on, as soon as they stop the diet!
                There has to be another way.<br><br>
                What if you could lose weight, without being on a 'diet' or attending a slimming club?<br><br>
                Well with powerful hypnotic interventions and challenging the thoughts and feelings attached to food we really can create a positive and healthy relationship with food and achieve those weight loss goals.

            <h3>Are you looking to overcome an addiction?</h3>
            <p>Drug addiction, alcohol, gambling, porn, there are so many things that we can focus on purely to help us to get through life. But this habit is meeting our emotional needs in some way. More often than not, what we are looking for in the thing we are addicted to is escapism, risk or uncertainty. 
            </p>
            <p class="textHide">But as we are all aware, an addiction can cost us much more than the money we waste on it, it can also cost us relationships and sometimes our lives.</p>
            <p class="textHide">To help a client kick their habit, I use strategic intervention, graded exposure, counselling and hypnosis and when all of these effective tools are brought together it can mean that finally they can feel that freedom in life that they have wanted for so long.</p>

            <h3>Are you struggling in your relationship?</h3>
            <p>In Couples counselling I use a variety of therpeutic approaches to tailor therapy to my clients particular needs. Often there is a need to restore trust, improve communication and re-visit the hey day of the relationship.
            </p>
            <p class="textHide">But as we are all aware, an addiction can cost us much more than the money we waste on it, it can also cost us relationships and sometimes our lives.</p>

So many clients have waited until their relationship is in tatters and they have lost all respect for each other, but even in these circumstances it is possible to regain the love they thought was dead.</strong></i></p>

            <h4>What happens in the first session?</h4>
            <p>Our first session is an opportunity for us to begin exploring your presenting issue and to decide if we 'fit', because it is a very unique relationship, and it is important that you feel comfortable with your therapist. You will have the chance to ask any questions about therapy and I will talk a little about how I work and use Hypnosis in addition to other approaches to tailor therapy to your specific needs.
                <br><br>If you agree to working together, while I cannot be precise I will be able to give you some idea about how many sessions you may need. Whenever possible in the first session I do like to give you the opportunity to experience Hypnosis and almost without exception clients find it very relaxing....</p>
